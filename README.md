# ABOUT THIS ADD-ON

This Add-On enables The One Ring in Minecraft.

Very rarely the unique Item will spawn in your world underground in the dark. Should you find it, you can equip it in your Mainhand or Offhand and receive Invisibility.

Beware... The One Ring will damage you the longer you wear it
If you carry it and do not use it The One Ring may drop out of your inventory, perhaps seeking a more suitable host who will use its powers.
